# You must define an Account class. It should have the following behaviors:

# starting_balance that returns the starting balance loaded from the file
# current_balance that returns the ending balance after all transactions have been processed
# summary that returns an array of all of the transaction summaries


#Your Account class should have an instance variable that contains an array of its associated Transactions.

class Account

  def initialize(bank_data, balances)
    @balances = balances


  def starting_balance(balances)
    if balances[:account] = "Business"





def print_data(account)
  puts "==== #{file} ===="
  puts "Starting Balance: $201.94"
  puts "Ending Balance:   $637.09"

    file.each do |transactions|
      puts "$#{amount}   {type}  #{date} - #{Description}"
